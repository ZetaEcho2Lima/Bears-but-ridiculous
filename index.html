        </p>
        <p class="px-lg-5"> The average bear is a better fisherman than me. I believe we should domesticate bears in order to have them fish for us in masses.
          We would never run out of foot and everyone would have sufficient omega-3 fatty acids.

            <p class="card-body">This is a display of dominance, a game bears play, really. 
              If one bear can consume the bottom jaw of the other, the other will not last long. 
              This is the most brutal form of dominance. Life ending, really. 
              Fortunately, the game mostly ends without injury.</p>

            <p class="card-body">Bears are generally quite stinky creatures, but every year, 
              around the same time, they take bathes. This one is working on clearning his claws. 
              As you can see, he is not too happy about having to do this.</p>

              a dog trying to covertly beg for food, knowing it is against the house rules.<br><br>
            In all seriousness, though, feeding a bear is bad. 
            They will accociate humans with food and get in big trouble and eventually shot by us humans. Not cool.</p>
